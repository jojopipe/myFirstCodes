/*
You are working on a ticketing system. A ticket costs $10.
The office is running a discount campaign: each group of 5 people is getting a discount, which is determined by the age of the youngest person in the group.
You need to create a program that takes the ages of all 5 people as input and outputs the total price of the tickets.

Sample Input:
55
28
15
38
63

Sample Output:
42.5

The youngest age is 15, so the group gets a 15% discount from the total price, which is $50 - 15% = $42.5

int main() {
    int ages[5];

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        std::cin >> ages[i];
    }

    double total = 50;

    int min;
    int i = 0;
    min = ages[i];

    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++)
    {
        if (ages[i + 1] < ages[i])
        {
            min = ages[i + 1];
        }
    }

    total /= 100;
    total *= (100 - min);

    std::cout << total;


    return 0;
}
